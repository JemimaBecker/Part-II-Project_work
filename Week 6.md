lncRNAs that im going to look at:
- the subset that are differentially expressed in more than one cell type
- the ones that are significantly differentially expressed in luminal differentiated cells only.

| lncRNA gene name | group | differentially expressed protein coding genes | conservation of lncRNA | conservation of protein |
