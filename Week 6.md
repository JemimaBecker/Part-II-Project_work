lncRNAs that im going to look at:
- the subset that are differentially expressed in more than one cell type (different_multiple - M)
- the ones that are significantly differentially expressed in luminal differentiated cells only (unique - U).

of the lncRNAs differentially expressed in luminal differentiated cells, 170 of these show differential expression specific to LD cells, while 64 show differential expression in one or more other cell types in the mammary gland.

Filtering again to a more stringent p value of <0.05:
- 119 unique
- 59 shared genes
