lncRNAs that im going to look at:
- the subset that are differentially expressed in more than one cell type (different_multiple - M)
- the ones that are significantly differentially expressed in luminal differentiated cells only (unique - U).

of the lncRNAs differentially expressed in luminal differentiated cells, 170 of these show differential expression specific to LD cells, while 64 show differential expression in one or more other cell types in the mammary gland.

Looking more closesly at the genes that are differentially expressed in the luminal differnetiated cells adn then one or more other cell types
- 64 total
- of these, 21 have no equivalent in humans
- and 43 have an equivalent (not necessarily wth sequence conservation) in a syntenic locus in humans

having a quick look at gene ontologies etc on enrichr for (all) proteins that are differentially expressed in LD cells AND are within 1mb of a highly differntially expressed lncRNA
