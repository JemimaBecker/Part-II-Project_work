## Project aims
Two key parts:
- Examination of the expression of known imprinted lncRNAs
- Global hypothesis-free testing to find novel lncRNAs associated with mammary gland development.

### Materials and methods
R
data: RNAseq, four developmental stages, six cell types, four reciprocal crosses (CL57BL6/CAST)

## Schedules and weekly goals

### Week 1
- [x] Get set up on Jeremy
- [x] Read in expression matrix and metadata
- [x] Explore data by plotting some basic expression plots a few known imprinted lncRNAs vs stage/age/cell type
- [x] Start GitHub lab book - upload code and plot along with project description / aims etc

### Week 2
- [ ] Look at stage specific differential expression for known lncRNAs (e.g. H19, Airn, Gtl2, Nespas, Snhg14 & Kcnq1ot1)
- [ ] Look for other lncRNAs in a data driven way with significant expression differences
- [ ] Identify, per lncRNA, differentially expressed protein-coding genes within e.g. 1Mb up/downstream
