## project aims
Through my research project I aim to identify a cohort of lncRNAs: molecules which are differentially expressed according to developmental stage, and which show cell type specific expression. Of this group I will identify a subset that show monoallelic expression â€“ indicating that they are transcribed from imprinted loci. With this work I should identify previously characterised imprinted lncRNAs such as H19, as well as novel ones.

The data used for this work will comprise RNAseq data from six different cell types at ten different time points during the adult mammary gland developmental cycle. This data will be drawn from reciprocal crosses between mouse strains that have known SNP differences, thus allowing identification of bias in parental origin of the transcriptome.

This work will be conducted primarily using R, and the results should serve as a useful resource for later study of imprinted lncRNAs.
