## Project aims
Two key parts:
- Examination of the behaviour of known imprinted lncRNAs
- Global hypothesis-free testing to find novel lncRNAs associated with mammary gland development.

### Materials and methods
R
data: RNAseq, four developmental stages, six cell types, four reciprocal crosses (CL57BL6/CAST)

## Schedules and weekly goals

### Week 1
- [x] Get set up on Jeremy
- [x] Read in expression matrix and metadata
- [x] Explore data by plotting some basic expression plots a few known imprinted lncRNAs vs stage/age/cell type
- [x] Start GitHub lab book - upload code and plot along with project description / aims etc

### Week 2/3
- [x] Look at stage specific differential expression for known lncRNAs (e.g. H19, Airn, Gtl2, Nespas, Snhg14 & Kcnq1ot1)
- [x] Look for other lncRNAs in a data driven way with significant expression differences

narrow down field of study by focussing on luminal differentiated and progenitor cells only

### Week 4
- [x] Identify, per lncRNA, differentially expressed protein-coding genes within e.g. 1Mb up/downstream

### Week 5
- [x] check with cell type shows the most significant difference in lncRNA
- [x] Identify the most promising cell type to work on
- [x] identify the most interesting/dynamic/hihgly expressed lncRNA in that cell type

### Week6 
- [x] Check the conservation of lncRNAs that you identified last week
- [x] check the proxomity of protein coding genes to the lncRNA that you selected
- [x] start working with allele specific expression
