Looking for lncRNAs that overlap with a regulatory sequence

data from http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/ (Ensembl data)
code used is on a different doc

run on the 170 differentially expressed lncRNAs that were uniquely differentially expressed in luminal differentiated cells

of these 170, 155 (~91%) overlapped a regulatory region

|Regulatory feature| Promoter  |CTCF binding site|Promoter flank|Enhancer|TF binding site|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
|# overlaps|102|90|81|47|23|
|%lncRNAs that overlap|60.0%|52.9%|47.6%|27.6%|13.5%|
